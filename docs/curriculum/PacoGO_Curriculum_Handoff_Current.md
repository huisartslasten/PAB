# PacoGO Curriculum — Current Handoff

> **HANDOFF IS THE CROSS-CHAT SOURCE OF TRUTH.** Every new chat working on PacoGO Curriculum must read this file first.

## 1. Current position

PacoGO is a learning/curriculum platform. The curriculum engine is the scientific decision layer; learner-facing Learning Interfaces are built on top of it.

Working branch: `refactor/professional-v1`  
`main` / LIVE must not be touched.

## 2. Engineering workflow

Before every build step: Full Regression → green means build → red means stop and isolate the exact root cause → classify cause → design the proper underlying solution → implement → Full Regression again. Never guess or symptom-patch. Tests are changed only when demonstrably incorrect or when an intentional contract change has been correctly designed.

Always report the exact commit tested and the actual regression result.

## 3. Scientific curriculum engine

C1–C9 are complete.

Core chain:
`curriculum → skill → development → claim → task → learner performance → evidence → evidence assessment → inference → mastery → next action → learner state → validation`

- C1: claim-centred validation design; feasibility, discriminating and longitudinal phases separated.
- C2: learner/context → task instance → interaction/observation → evidence assessment → inference → decision.
- C3: evidence coding includes target match, performance, process, quality, contradiction, prompting/independence, alternatives and reliability.
- C4: discriminating tasks and readiness gates; 19 tasks over 10 developments, model families M0–M4.
- C5: developmental ordering distinguished from sequence, temporal precedence, prediction, prerequisite and causality; alternatives, invariance, longitudinal design and model comparison explicit.
- C6: mastery is claim/development/scope/time bounded; seven gates; no automatic promotion.
- C7: prerequisite ordering and next-development ordering remain separate.
- C8: observed evidence, inference, mastery and decision remain distinct over time.
- C9: validates the complete vertical chain and explicit claim selection at multi-claim boundaries.

## 4. Curriculum cases

A1 — Getallen representeren en verbinden is the construction/reference case.

B1 — Optellen and FR2 — Breukequivalentie herkennen en gebruiken remain candidate generalisation cases. Registry presence is not empirical promotion.

## 5. Scientific validation — completed design baseline

Completed:
- validation data specification;
- scientific validation protocol;
- W2 repeated-measurement protocol and analysis contract;
- construct-specific validation design;
- A1 study protocol;
- A1 preregistration-readiness specification;
- A1 population/instrument selection gate.

The scientific protocol remains a design baseline, not evidence that PacoGO is scientifically validated. PacoGO remains scientifically grounded, designed and empirically testable, but not empirically validated.

## 6. W2 / C5 boundary

W2 is design-only longitudinal readiness infrastructure. Developmental ordering, prerequisite inference, causal inference, mastery classification, registry promotion and mastery-rule changes remain explicitly blocked.

## 7. Learning Interface System

Build reusable pedagogical instruments, not one traditional lesson per skill.

Conceptual chain:
`skill → development → required interaction forms → Learning Interface(s) → task/evidence`

Interfaces must separate pedagogical/function state from visual/rendering state and remain ready for future PacoGO Deluxe / Upper Tier integration.

The interface runtime contract must preserve:
`interaction → observable event → evidence target → coding dimension → validation dataset field`.

## 8. Current engineering implementation

A1 Number Line, B1 Addition and FR2 Fraction Equivalence now demonstrate the same browser vertical-slice bridge:
`browser interaction → interaction controller → observation → shared browser runtime → curriculum registry → learner-state/decision flow`.

Reusable engine components:
- `pacogo-engine/addition-controller.js` — reusable B1 quantity-addition interaction controller;
- `pacogo-engine/addition-controller.test.js` — B1 evidence/interaction contract test;
- `pacogo-engine/fraction-equivalence-controller.js` — reusable FR2 equivalence interaction controller;
- `pacogo-engine/fraction-equivalence-controller.test.js` — FR2 evidence/interaction contract test;
- `pacogo-engine/browser-vertical-slice.js` — shared browser-to-registry runtime for task resolution and observation submission;
- `pacogo-engine/browser-vertical-slice.test.js` — runtime delegation, task lookup, duplicate-task and input-contract tests.

Browser vertical slices using the shared runtime:
- `curriculum-a1-numberline.html` — A1-T01;
- `curriculum-b1-addition.html` — B1-T01;
- `curriculum-fr2-fraction-equivalence.html` — FR2-T01.

The three pages no longer duplicate direct curriculum-registry task lookup / observation-cycle wiring. The page layer remains responsible for presentation and interaction wiring; curriculum execution is delegated through the shared runtime.

FR2 controller lifecycle explicitly prevents duplicate submission after an observation has been emitted.

No Supabase change was required for this browser-runtime generalisation.

## 9. Current next engineering step

The first shared browser vertical-slice generalisation across A1, B1 and FR2 is complete. Next, continue from the shared runtime boundary rather than adding more page-specific curriculum logic. Strengthen reusable Learning Interface/controller contracts where a real architectural gap is demonstrated, and only then expand the vertical slice to additional task/development coverage.

Do not add scientific claims or freeze construct-specific mastery rules from synthetic browser data.

## 10. Latest regression state

Latest user-confirmed Full Regression:
- Commit: `43840bc7e81bf1ad4e11bc1308215a55fa2fc365`
- Branch: `refactor/professional-v1`
- Status: **GREEN** (user-confirmed)

Recent engineering commits:
- `2843e2c5383e02da1c1147d6db19a9c0e114baea` — shared browser vertical slice runtime;
- `6595e78572866f61f1cdf5e459709c7e61bb8bea` — shared runtime contract tests;
- `75613901a4c28f69ae28fede42c1d744a7dcdc91` — A1 page migrated to shared runtime;
- `2836df542afbd26482383ff6388666aac18ef0fa` — B1 page migrated to shared runtime;
- `43840bc7e81bf1ad4e11bc1308215a55fa2fc365` — FR2 page migrated to shared runtime.

GitHub status data is not currently exposing CI results for these commits; the latest regression state above is therefore explicitly recorded as user-confirmed rather than independently verified by GitHub status.

## 11. Supabase

No Supabase schema/runtime change is required for the current browser vertical-slice work. Change Supabase only for a real persistence/runtime contract requirement.

## 12. Strategy

**Build the brain → prove the vertical chain → build reusable Learning Interfaces/controllers → connect multiple curriculum cases through the same engine → empirically validate with real learners → then build the larger Deluxe world.**
